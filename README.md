R_VALUE
=======

The main objective of the [VALUE](http://www.value-cost.eu) COST action is the validation and integrating downscaling methods for climate change research. To this aim, a number of [indices and measures] (http://www.value-cost.eu/reports) have been identified in order to validate different aspects of the downscaling methods. These indices have been implemented in R by the VALUE members and are collected in this package for further extension.   

This package also includes some auxiliary R functions used to read the observational datasets and a number of predictors from ERA-Interim (remotely from the Santander MetGroup [TDS](http://www.meteo.unican.es/en/dataservices)) as well as the  the auxiliary (and wrapper) functions used by the [VALUE validation portal](http://www.value-cost.eu/validationportal) to compute these indices.
